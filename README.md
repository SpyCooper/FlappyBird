# Flappy Bird

A recreation of Flappy Bird in Java.

## Description

This program is a simple recreation of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, developed using Java. The player presses SPACE to jump higher. As the player goes through the opening in the pipes, they gain a point. The game ends when the player hits a pipe or the ground.

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain source files
- `bin`: the folder with compiled output files from running the program in VSCode
- `images`: the folder for the images that are embedded in the README.md file

## Execution

I ran this using the in app run command for VSCode with the "Test Runner for Java" extension in the "Extension Pack for Java" package in VSCode, but any way to run java files should be viable.
